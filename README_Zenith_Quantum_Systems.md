# Zenith Quantum Systems

**Architectures for the Next Paradigm in Computation**  
By Alejandro Efraín Kurday (Zenith)

This repository unifies key breakthroughs in quantum information theory, teleportable computation, and predictive qubit logic into a cohesive framework. Built upon the ACTA model, this system expands with practical performance benchmarks and energy efficiency insights.

## Core Papers

### 1. Active Quantum Teleportation Architecture (ACTA)
A novel model where quantum computation is achieved by teleporting quantum states between two nodes, allowing logic to occur in transit.

**Key Features:**
- Cyclic qubit teleportation
- In-transit state collisions
- Trans-temporal processing

### 2. Predictive Qubit Cloning for Performance & Energy Efficiency
Extends ACTA by utilizing the transient shadow of a qubit during teleportation to perform predictive computation.

**Highlights:**
- Up to 5x faster execution
- Energy use reduced from 1000 µJ to 200 µJ
- Practical benchmarks and visual comparison
