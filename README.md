**Architectures for the Next Paradigm in Computation**  
By Alejandro Efraín Kurday (Zenith)

This repository introduces a new layer of quantum computation theory rooted in teleportable information, fractal compression, and refractive temporal replication. It expands on ACTA (Active Quantum Teleportation Architecture) and pushes beyond traditional cloning limitations with a novel, compliant, and efficient model.

## Latest Update:  
### **Temporal Refractive Qubit Replication in Quantum Transport Fields**  

This paper presents a revolutionary concept: quantum replication without cloning.  
A qubit, upon entering a low-density transitional field, refracts into temporary manifestations that execute simultaneous tasks across multiple vectors — before reintegrating into its original form.

**Key Benefits:**
- Compliant with the no-cloning theorem  
- Multi-instance functional execution  
- True non-local quantum processing  
- **Performance boost: 6.7x – 10x vs traditional models**
